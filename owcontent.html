			Endorsements
		</h1>
		<p class="gm">
			Did you just play with someone you liked in your most recent match? 
			Do you want to reward them? Well, Overwatch allows you to endorse positive 
			players in your matches!
		</p>
			<img src="images/endorsement.png" alt="No Work" class="endorse">
		<h2>
		ENDORSEMENT LEVELS
		</h2>
		<p class="gm">
			All players begin at endorsement level 1 and can progress to a max level of 5; 
			every endorsement you receive impacts your endorsement levels. 
			You will also receive a small amount of player experience for endorsing another player.
			Higher endorsement levels can help you get better groups in the Looking for Group tool.
		</p>
		<h3>
		MAINTAINING YOUR ENDORSEMENT LEVEL
		</h3>
		<p class="gm">
			Your endorsement level can decrease if you do not continue to 
			receive endorsements or leave games before theyâ€™re finished.
			Punishments within the reporting system may also strip players
			of their endorsement level and place them at level 0.
		</p>
		<h2 class="er">
			ENDORSEMENT REWARDS
		</h2>
		<p class="gm">
			You can occasionally earn Loot 
			Boxes based on your current endorsement level, 
			with higher endorsement levels resulting in more Loot Boxes. 
			During special events, you'll receive event Loot Boxes
